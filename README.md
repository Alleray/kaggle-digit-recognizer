MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits and it's kind of "Hello World" in Machine Learning.

My model is definitely not the best model there is, but it achieved the accuracy of 0.94885 on the test set.
I will update the model soon, currently planned:
- reshape the input data from a 1D vector back to a 2D matrix.
  I think the accuracy should increase because reshaping will bring back the shapes of the digits.
- try to implement a Convolutional NN architecture. CNNs are better in the field of computer vision.
- look for the open submissions of other competitors. Should give some useful insights.
